  Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Darsh Jariwala</strong>, a passionate interior designer based in Gujarat with a Bachelor's degree in Interior Design from Veer Narmad South Gujarat University.
  <br /><br />
  I specialize in creating functional, modern, and aesthetically pleasing spacesâ€”whether residential, commercial, or retail.
  With a strong focus on detail, balance, and usability, I bring a fresh and client-focused approach to every project.
  <br /><br />
  My goal is to design spaces that not only look beautiful but feel purposeful and personal to those who use them.
